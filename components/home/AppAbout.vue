                It all started with disassembling my first computer when I was 10.
                I was curious about how it works, so I started learning about it.
                I was a self-taught kid, and I learned a lot about computers and the
                internet. I was a gamer, so I learned how to install games and
                drivers, and how to fix the computer when it was broken. I was
                interested in how the internet works, so I learned HTML and CSS.
                <br />
                In highschool, I learned Python, but I was not so into it. I was
                more interested in web development. I started learning about user experience and user interface design. 
                Then, I started my degree in Web Development, called CFGS Web App Development in Spain. After ending the degree,
                I joined Omniaccess as an Intern and 3 months later, as a Full Stack Junior.
